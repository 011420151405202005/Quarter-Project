					<p class="para"> Kali is the first original character in this Alternate Universe. Her origins are still unknown but she first appeared in Trikru territory in the year 2140. She stayed there for 2 years training as a seken and git acquainted with young Gona Anya. In the early 2143 she traveled and stayed in seclusion with the Ocean people or Floukru. Her final destination was the capital, Polis. There she stayed for 2 years before mysteriously disappearing in winter early 2145 and hasn't been heard of since. </p>

					<p class="para"> Anya kom Triku is famously known as the coalition's high general or as Commander Lexa's fo's. She was born in 2122 to a gona couple in Trikru but became an orphan half a decade later. Due to not having any family she grew up strong and independent if not a little rough. Not much is known about her early life, just that she was a great second and even more a formidable warrior later on. In recent years, she has been known to be arguably the best warrior in all 12 clans.

She stayed and became one the best natblida in the capital before being bested by Lexa during the conclave. She is the sole of age natblida survivor after Lexa's ascension.

					<p class="para"> Lexa kom Trikru is the Commander and founder of the kongeda or the coalition of the 12 clans. It is said that her great skills in combat are only matched by her wisdom in war.
She was born in 2128 and like all nightbloods, she was sent to Polis at age 5. She became the best natblida at age 11, 12 months after being Anya's seken. She won the conclave and ascended the following year. It was also during that time that she had a vision and started the planning for the union of all the individual clans she presided over.

					<p class="para"> Kala is the second original main character in this alternate reality. Much like Kali, her origins are unknown. She also first appeared in Trikru territory, where she first met and saved a wounded Anya. By an unusual but fortunate circumstance she formed a familial bond with the general. Three months after they met, the younger stumbled upon Lexa alone having an intense battle with bandits. She unknowingly saved the commander's life which she didn't know would result in all of their lives being entwined with each other. </p>
